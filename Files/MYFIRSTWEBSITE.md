# ReactMultiply
This repository was my first attempt to make a web app using ReactJS.  
 
ReactJS has been implemented inside script tags in the HTML file.  
  
Thought of making this app after seeing my little sister struggle with multiplication.  
  
This web page has four difficulty modes....Easy, Medium, Hard, Master.  
  
This web page gives you 10 questions one after another and tells your score after completing all the 10 questions.  
  
Go and visit the website at [Multiply](https://bajajgirik.github.io/ReactMultiply/ "MultiplyIt").
